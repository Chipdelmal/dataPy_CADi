# dataPy: Scripts

This folder contains the coding exercises for the course. It is all coded in Python and most of the exercises were compiled from a variety of sources (listed at the top of each one of the scripts). The code is provided as **.py** files and its meant to be translated to **.ipynb** throughout the workshop (unless otherwise stated).


For a breakdown of where it fits within the bootcamp please look at the [sitemap](../md/sitemap.md).

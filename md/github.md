# dataPy: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and Github

Git is, first and foremost, a [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) system. But what is a [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) system?

We've all been in a situation in which we are working in a document/code and we make changes but we still want to keep a copy of the previous state of the file in case something goes wrong. So what do we do? We usually try to keep track of the files by adding version numbers, but it usually takes just a couple of days for this system to start showing it's deficiencies: it's difficult to standardize/enforce. Even worse, in coding we usually work with several different files at the same time, which makes the manual system impossible to maintain in the long run.

This is why, [git](https://git-scm.com/) exists: *To make persistent copies of the history of our source files so that we can always go back to a previously working version*.

##  [GitHub](www.github.com)

[GitHub](www.github.com) is the most popular web-based [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) service that uses the [git](https://git-scm.com/) protocol. It is very popular for programming projects due to its ability to provide access control, bug tracking, wikis, feature requests, amongst many other features.

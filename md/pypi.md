# dataPy: [pypi](https://pypi.org/)

[Python package index (pypi)](https://pypi.org/) is the largest repository for python packages (with a codebase of around 175,000+ to date). It is analogous to the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) repository for [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and it is just as easy to use once it's setup for the first time, although one of the advantages of [pypi](https://pypi.org/) over [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) is the variety of areas of knowledge covered by it ([R](https://www.r-project.org/) tends to be favored mostly by stats and biology related fields).

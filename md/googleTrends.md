Unfortunately, no official API exists, so there is no built-in support to parsing and doing analysis over these data. This, however, is a minor limitation, as there are some alternatives in [python](https://www.python.org/), such as [pytrends](https://github.com/GeneralMills/pytrends).


##  [PyTrends](https://github.com/GeneralMills/pytrends)

This package is an unofficial [google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/) parser, maintained by a community of contributors. It is simple, yet sufficient for most applications.

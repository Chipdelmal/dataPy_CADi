##  Goals and Objectives

This is an intensive bootcamp designed to teach the fundamentals and tools used for data manipulation in Python. As such, it is good to keep in mind the over-arching objective of the workshop: **To understand and get familiar with Python's most commonly used tools to do data analysis**.

### What will we cover?

* **Python introduction**: Basic python concepts along with the management of packages, environments and best practices will be covered.
* **Python development IDE comparison**: We will touch on some of the most common ways to develop code in Python (Jupyter, Spyder, Atom).
* **Creating libraries**:
* **Git**: Understanding git, how we can use it for version control, and how to collaborate
* **Data wrangling**: Using pandas and numpy for data manipulation

### This bootcamp is not...

* **... an in-depth Python course**: This three-day workshop is not intended to be a thorough Python course. Python is a very rich and deep programming language. It's flexibility and...
* **... a course on Data Analysis**: Data analysis is a rich and dynamic topic which is rapidly becoming a subject of study on its own. As such, it is impossible to cover...
* **... a course on Data Visualization**: Similar to data analysis,

##  Getting started

The first steps to get this bootcamp started are to:

* **Install Python**
* **Install Anaconda**
* **Get a Github account**
* **Get a Twitter dev account**

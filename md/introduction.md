# dataPy: Introduction

Before getting into the code, let's take some time for introductions and objectives!

## [My background](./myBackground.md)

[_I'm a **Computer Scientist/Mechatronics Engineer** working in modeling processes related to the spread/control of mosquito-borne diseases. My main lines of research focus on simulating the **spatiotemporal spread of gene-drives in mosquito populations**. I am particularly interested in the application of CS/Engineering methodologies (network theory, optimization techniques, individual-based modeling, etcetera) to stop the spread of vector-borne diseases. In the past I've worked in **animal vocalizations analysis, robotics, computer vision, electronics instrumentation and automotive industry**._](./myBackground.md)

##  Goals and Objectives

This is an intensive bootcamp designed to teach the fundamentals and tools used for data manipulation in Python. As such, it is good to keep in mind the over-arching objective of the workshop: **To understand and get familiar with Python's most commonly used tools to do data analysis**.

### [What will we cover?](./sitemap.md)

* **Python introduction**: Basic python concepts along with the management of packages, environments and best practices will be covered.
* **Python development IDE comparison**: We will touch on some of the most common ways to develop code in Python (Jupyter, Spyder, Atom).
* **Creating libraries**: How to bundle a python package so that others can install and run it.
* **Git**: Understanding git, how we can use it for version control, and how to collaborate
* **Data wrangling**: Using pandas and numpy for data manipulation



### This bootcamp is not...

* **... an in-depth Python course**: This three-day workshop is not intended to be a thorough Python course. Python is a very rich and deep programming language. It's flexibility and...
* **... a course on Data Analysis**: Data analysis is a rich and dynamic topic which is rapidly becoming a subject of study on its own. As such, it is impossible to cover...
* **... a course on Data Visualization**: Similar to data analysis, this is a very complex subject that should be covered in a different bootcamp. However, you can have a look at the [dataViz CADi repository](https://github.com/Chipdelmal/dataViz_CADi) for some ideas, scripts, and general information.


### Some final warnings

* **Code style**: I tried to be as consistent as possible whilst following conventions, but there might be mixed sections every here and there.
* **Code comments**: Most of the code is thoroughly commented, but there might be sections which require more explanations.
* **Data Sources**: Some of the exercises depend on external servers which might limit our number of requests. In those cases, the data was also stored as a copy in the **data** folder of this repository.

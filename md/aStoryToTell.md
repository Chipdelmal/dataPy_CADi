# dataPy: A Story to Tell

At the core of any data analysis task, there is an underlying story about how the data was gathered, why, and how we use it to obtain knowledge.

## Important Questions

Lately, there has been a certain tendency to try to do machine learning and data science as and end, more than the means to solve problems. This is not really a problem in on itself, but it does pose challenges that might lead to undesired results.

### Why?



### How?

### What are we looking for?

### Are the data reliable?

### Do we have contact with the people who gathered the data?

<hr>

## Warnings!

### Data will not generate knowledge by itself


###  Data are not Unbiased

More often than not, data are gathered by people with intentions and budgets.

###  [Correlations Everywhere!](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)

Publicly available datasets are good to do initial explorations of promising research avenues. It is important to note, however, that analyzing datasets over and over will, undoubtedly, return correlations between variables that would not do so in a carefully designed experimental framework.

Without statistical advice, and with some motivated reasoning, it is easy to fall into traps.

[_"Considering how big data's spurious correlations far outnumber the valid causal relationships, it's always best to approach them all with a healthy skepticism. Some people, such as data scientists, might have a personal or professional interest in believing the spurious. These beliefs, plus the natural human tendency to succumb to confirmation biases, tend to short-circuit the skepticism and critical thinking that we expect from the best analysts. The more intelligent and authoritative a data scientist or analyst is, the more likely they are to convince unwitting others that their wishful correlations are indeed valid."_](https://www.ibmbigdatahub.com/blog/big-datas-bogus-correlations)

###  [Visualization Bias!](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368)

Visualizing data without careful thought can lead to errors in perception. It is important to take this into account, not only to present our results, but specially when using visualizations

###  [Data mean different things to different people!](https://medium.com/multiple-views-visualization-research-explained/data-is-personal-what-we-learned-from-42-interviews-in-rural-america-93539f25836d)

We tend to think of data as a concrete, tangible, element without any allegiance or affiliation, which leads us to think that people will read it



[_"In fact, for many people, the data and the visualization were synonymous. For these people, the pipeline from data to design is clean and clear, without bias or rhetoric."_](https://medium.com/multiple-views-visualization-research-explained/data-is-personal-what-we-learned-from-42-interviews-in-rural-america-93539f25836d)

## Bigger Picture

### Get personal with the data

###  Think of how the data relates to the project

###  Look ahead for ways to effectively convey the ideas stored in the data

At the end of the day, we want data to mean something.

# dataPy: [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

[Data frames](https://github.com/mobileink/data.frame/wiki/What-is-a-Data-Frame%3F) are a ubiquitous tool in data analysis. In their most generic sense, they can be thought of as data records stored in a "tabular" form. This makes them ideal for most of day to day data analysis applications, as it is a pretty natural way to think about data collection. This will probably feel natural to [R](https://www.r-project.org/) programmers, but [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) programmers might wonder what the advantages of using these structures are (in contrasts to using structures, or dictionaries). Whilst it is true that we could implement more efficient algorithms and data structures if we devote enough time to do so, we have to take a step back and think of our needs. If we are still in a data exploration stage of our project, we are probably going to need flexibility, and that's what data frames excel at. By far, the most popular tool to manipulate data frames in Python is [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). It is a well documented, efficient library to manipulate data in a cohesive, consistent way.

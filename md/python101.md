# dataPy: Python 101 (part 1)

Let's get started with some python programming! For the introduction to the language, head to either of:
* https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_interpreter
* https://repl.it/

and type:

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

Now that we have gotten tradition out of the way, let's look at the fundamental types of the Python language.

## Scalar Types


### Numeric

Integers and floating-point numbers are fundamental types in Python. Integers can store arbitrarily long numbers, and floats are

```python
iValue = 1384891
print(iValue ** 4)
```


```python
print(3/2)
print(3//2)
```

###  Strings

###  Booleans

###  None

###  Dates and Times

### Casting

<hr>

##  Control Flow

###  if, elif, else

Ternary expression

```value = true-expr if condition else false-expr```

###  for loops

###  while loops

###  pass

###  range

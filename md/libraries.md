# dataPy: Libraries

One of the main features of Python is the availability of community libraries readily available. Unlike other languages and platforms (such as R or Matlab), which are more focused on certain applications, Python spans a wide range of applications which include:

* Machine Learning: PyTorch, TensorFlow
* Data Analysis: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib
* Computer Vision:
* General Science: SciKit Learn
* Engineering:
* Biology:
* Social Science:

##  Installing Libraries

By far, the easiest and most common way to install Python packages is through [Pypi](https://pypi.org/).

### [Pypi](./pypi.md)

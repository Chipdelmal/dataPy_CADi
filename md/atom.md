# dataPy: [Atom](https://atom.io)

[Atom](https://atom.io) is a cross-platform open-source IDE for development in several programming languages. This text editor was developed by the [github](https://github.com/atom) team as a fast and versatile IDE for users that want the maximum level of control over their development environment.

As mentioned before, as it was developed by the [github](https://github.com/atom) team itself, this version control system is directly integrated into the editor.

##  Using [atom](https://atom.io)

### As text editor with terminal

### With Hydrogen

For experienced users, combining atom with the [Hydrogen](https://nteract.io/atom) kernel runner might be a useful extension. This package allows running code line by line, and plotting results within the editor (along with variable "watchers").

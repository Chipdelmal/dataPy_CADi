# dataPy: IDEs

Due to its popularity, python has several alternatives in terms of integrated developing environments. Throughout this bootcamp, we will go through three of the most commonly used open source options: [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), and [Atom](https://atom.io/).

##  Free and/or Open Source

Python's culture is based on open-source development and sharing of code. As such, several free and open source IDEs are readily available online for a variety of applications and programming tastes.

* [IDLE](./idle.md): Simple, lightweight IDE that comes packaged with Python installations.
* [Spyder](./spyder.md): Python's ["R-Studio"](https://www.rstudio.com/) IDE.
* [Jupyter](./jupyter.md): Most popular IDE for data analysis.
* [nteract](./nteract.md): A new alternative to run jupyter notebooks in a desktop app.
* [Atom](./atom.md): A flexible and lightweight IDE for Python and many other languages.

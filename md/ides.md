# dataPy: IDEs

Due to its popularity, python has several alternatives in terms of integrated developing environments. Throughout this bootcamp, we will go through three of the most commonly used open source options: [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), and [Atom](https://atom.io/).

##  Free and/or Open Source

### [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html)

[IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html) is an integrated development environment that comes packed with the standard python installation. It is a pretty basic but useful as it is a cross-platform tool to get python code running.

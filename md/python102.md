# dataPy: Python 102

Object-Oriented programming is a widespread coding paradigm. It is worth noting that we can code in Python without dwelling too much into **OOP** concepts (as we have been doing so far); however, having a basic understanding of these fundamentals can prove useful when moving into more complex applications.

The basic idea behind OOP is that we can define **classes** that have **attributes** and perform **actions**.
